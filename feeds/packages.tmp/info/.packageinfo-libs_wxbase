Description:   wxBase contains most of the non-GUI classes from the wxWindows cross-
  -platform C++ framework. There are 2 categories: generally useful portable
  code (date/time handling, command line parsing, regular expression support)
  and wrappers for the OS objects (files, directories, sockets, threads,
  etc.) allowing you to write portable programs easily.
